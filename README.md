Hello! This is the Week_1 pairing challenge project, Boris Bikes! :bike:
We've been commissioned by Transport for London, the body responsible for delivery of a new bike system, to build the best bike system in London. :rocket:
We're going to create a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use. By building a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream into a reality.
